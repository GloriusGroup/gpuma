# Installation

## Option 1: Install from PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install gpuma
```

This installs `gpuma` together with its core dependencies. Make sure you are using
Python 3.12 or newer.

## Option 2: Install from source

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/niklashoelter/gpuma.git
cd gpuma

# install using (uv) pip
uv pip install .
# or, without uv:
pip install .
```
